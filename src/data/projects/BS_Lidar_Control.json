    "abstract": "• **Problem**: Advanced autonomous driving typically relies on high-spec hardware, establishing a barrier to entry for basic research and accessibility.\n• **Solution**: Focused on **utilizing LiDAR sensors in low-spec environments** (Windows 10, Python) to avoid small static obstacles. Implemented a **simplified avoidance algorithm** that detects traffic cones and generates target points for steering control.\n• **Result**: Verified stable **maneuvering between traffic cones** through the proposed algorithm, demonstrating the efficiency of this simplified approach and **enhancing accessibility** for autonomous driving implementation in resource-constrained environments.",
